## Introduction

R&D in electronics and programming with 5+ years of experiences. 

There are experience in embedded Firmware/Software(C/C++), application software (C#, Python, Window, Linux, Android, IOS), project analysis, IoT system (edge device, protocol(MQTT), gateway, back-end, etc.). Itâ€™s possible working with electronics hardware (schematic, layout). 

Solid knowledge:
- MCU/SOC/SOM programming C/C++, debugging, bug-fixing.
- Communication protocol: WIFI, ETH, BLE, CAN, MODBUS, NFC, etc.
- RTOS : freeRTOS, Azure RTOS - threadx, multi tasking/threading, none-blocking.
- Embedded GUI: TouchGFX, Azure GUIX.
- Low power consumption.

Quickly analysis and apply open-source project to reduce development period and product prototype.

Key experience:
- [Data logging and visualization](data_log_and_visilization.md)
- [Low power consumption](low_power_consumption.md)
- [Embedded GUI application](embedded_gui_application.md)
- [Software application: IOS, Android, Windows, Linux](software_app_page.md)
- Firmware/Software Bare-metal/RTOS (multi-tasking/threading).
- Firmware/Software debugging and bug-fix.
- Device development to production procedure.
